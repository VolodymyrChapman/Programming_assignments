# Programming_assignments
Assignments completed for various online courses in Machine Learning and data science (in Python, MatLab, R or Kotlin)

Currently included projects are:
- Final assignment of the IBM Data Analysis using Python course. Data processing and analysis skills gained in this course were
used in a 3-week placement in the Bioinformatics Department of the award-winning John Innes Centre, Norwich (a summary of the
work completed there included in the seq and machine-learning-on-sequence-data repositories of my GitHub)

- Simple Dice Roller App developed while studying the Google 'Developing Android Apps in Kotlin' course. Skills gained in creating
layouts and dynamic programming currently being used to develop an exam preparation app for GCSE Physics (using previous experience
as a high school physics teacher).
